Project Overview:
Universal Bank is a rapidly growing financial institution with a large base of deposit (liability) customers and a smaller group of loan (asset) customers. 
The bank aims to expand its loan portfolio by identifying existing depositors most likely to accept personal loan offers.

Objective:
Use the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm to predict whether a customer will accept a personal loan offer, helping the marketing team design smarter, data-driven campaigns with improved targeting efficiency.

Context:
A prior campaign achieved a 9% conversion rate among liability customers. Building on this success, this project applies predictive modeling to enhance future marketing strategy and optimize customer conversion.

Key Steps:
Data preprocessing and feature selection
Splitting into training and test datasets
Model training using k-NN classification
Evaluation with metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve

Outcome:
A predictive system that assists Universal Bank in targeting the right customers for personal loan campaigns.
